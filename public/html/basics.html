    <h1>NodeJS Basics</h1>

    <b>What is NodeJS?</b>
    <br>
    <div>NodeJS is basically a way of running JavaScript code. Before Node, JavaScript could only be applied to web browsers. By integrating a JavaScript engine (Chrome V8) with C++, the JavaScript code can now be applied outside browsers.

        Node is ideal for building highly scalable, data-intensive backend & real-time apps. 
        
        Being great for prototyping & agile gives Node an advantage over the alternatives, such as Django. Node is fast & used world-wide. 
        
        Source code will also be more clean & consistent, as there is JavaScript  in both on the frontend & backend.

        Note that Node is not a programming language or a framwork. It's a runtime enviroment for execution JavaScript
    </div>

    <br>
    <b>What do you use Node for?</b>
    <ul>
        <li>Api</li>
        <li>Webiste</li>
        <li>Standalone software</li>
        <li>Servers</li>
        <li>Commandline programs</li>
        <li>Scripts</li>
        <li>Interfaces</li>
      </ul>
    
    <p>To initiate npm, which is the world largest software registry, type npm init</p>
    <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/">More info about npm can be found here</a>
    <p>To escape Node in terminal press CTRL + c twice</p>
    <p>To run a file with Node type node **file** in the terminal</p>
    <p>You can also install nodemon, which is a tool that helps in the development-stage of an application. As soon as you write any new code, it automatically reruns the application</p>
    <p>Be aware, that you should never use nodemon, when publishing an application</p>
    <p>You install nodemon through the terminal with the following command: npm install -g nodemon. The -g means, its installed globally</p>
    <p>You can also use budo, if you just want to LiveReload your html pages, as you're writing them, including CSS injections</p>
    <p>This makes prototyping very fast and easy. To install budo: npm install budo -g</p>
    <p>You could also just use budo one time, in which case you write npx budo index.html --live --open</p>
    
    
    
    
    <b>Modules</b>
    <div>Modules are a fundamental part of NodeJS. Some modules are available globally, which means that we don't have to do anything to use them. In order to import modules, the function, *require()* is used in the app.js file.</div> 
    <br>
    <p>An example of this is the console.log()</p>
    <p>You can consider modules as a set of functions you want to include in your app</p>
    <b>Arrow functions vs functions</b>
    <p>Below is an example of arrow functions vs regular functions</p>
    <p>Regular function</p>
    <img src="../images/function.PNG">
    <p>Arrow function</p>
    <img src="../images/arrowfunction.PNG">
    <div>As you can see, the arrow function is much shorter to write.</div>
    <div>Furthermore, arrow functions don't have their own this or arguments binding. Instead, those identifiers are resolved in the lexical scope like any other variable. That means that inside an arrow function, this and arguments refer to the values of this and arguments in the environment the arrow function is defined in (i.e. "outside" the arrow function)</div>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">The text above is taken from stackoverflow: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34361379/are-arrow-functions-and-functions-equivalent-exchangeable">Link</a></p>

    

    

    <h2>Packages</h2>
    <p>First, you need an empty package.json file in ur directory</p>
    <p>To install a package, go to the right folder in the terminal, and write npm install **packagename**</p>
    <div>Express is a library for building API from npm.
        Express.js is a node web application framework, which is made for building: single-page, multi-page* & hybrid web applications. Is is the standard Server Framework for Node.js.</div>
    <p>To install express, write npm install express</p>

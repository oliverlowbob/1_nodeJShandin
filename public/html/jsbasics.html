    <h1>CSS, HTML and JavaScript</h1>
    <b>What is CSS?</b>
    <div>CSS is styling and formatting of a website. You can use external .css files, or you can use internal css, which you place in the header like this</div>
    <img src="../images/css.PNG">
    <div>Furthermore, you can use inline css, where you style the attribute when you make it. An example of this, is when you make a h1, you can write style="", and then style it as you like.</div>
    <div>For this project, im using Bootstrap, which is a template of css files, that makes everything look nicer and more modern. It also saves a lot of work, as css'ing can take a lot of time</div>
    <br>
    <b>What is HTML?</b>
    <div>HTML is the standard language for web pages. It's very easy to learn, and has a lot of possibilites. Currently, we use HTML 5</div>
    <div>HTML uses different tagging, to know what you're doing. What im writing here, is in a div tag, but could also be in a p tag</div>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/default.ASP"> A full list of tags can be found here</a>
    <br>
    <div>HTML sites consist of a header and a body. The header contains different elements, such as styling, title, and links to templates, such as bootstrap</div>
    <div>The body is where you put all the content of your website. The format looks like this</div>

    <b>What is JavaScript?</b>
    <div>JavaScript is the programming language of HTML. It's used to program the behavior of websites</div>
    <b>Objects</b>
    <p>Json objects</p>
    <p>Key value pair, seperated by commas</p>
    <p>{<br>
        "key": "values",<br> 
        "key2": {"anotherkey": 23},  <br>
        }</p>
    
    <p>value is a String, but could be any datatype. key2 is a nested object.</p>
    
    <b>JavaScript Object</b>
    <p>var myObject = {}</p>

    <p>To create a variable type var/let/const **variablename*</p>
    <p>const is constant, let and var is changing.</p>
    <p>var is function scoped, and let is block scoped</p>
    <p>Unlike Java, JavaScript only has 1 type of numbers</p>
    <p>JavaScript also works with booleans. Remember to use === when checking, to peform a hard check (otherwise 1 is true and 0 is false etc).</p>
    <p>Use commas instead of + when adding things. + will add to the String or int, while comma keeps it seperated</p>
    <p>Furthermore, you can make arrays. The syntax is 'var arrayname = ["element1", "element2"]'</p>
    <p>If you wish to find out, what type a variable is, you can use the typeof operator</p>
    <p>A variable without a value is 'undefined'. This is not to be confused with an empty value, which has a value and a type</p>
    <p>In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist, but its an object of the type null. You can empty and object by setting it to null</p>
    <p>Even though JavaScript can execute without semicolons at the end, its still good practice to keep them.</p>
